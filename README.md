* NOTE: This library is currently undergoing some changes, and may not work as expected. For questions, please contact Jeff Zemla at zemla@wisc.edu

This library contains many tools for analyzing semantic fluency data and estimating semantic networks from fluency data. Included is the U-INVITE method for constructing networks from semantic fluency data (Zemla, Kennett, Jun, & Austerweil, 2016).

Documentation is sparse-- `import rw` in Python, and look through the functions in `/rw` (particularly `core.py`), or check out a sample file `gen_subj_graphs.py`.
